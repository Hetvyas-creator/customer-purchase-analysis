# 📊 Customer Purchase Data Analysis  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project aims to analyze **customer purchase behavior** over a year using a structured dataset. The objective is to clean, process, and extract insights that could help businesses understand **buying patterns, payment preferences, and return trends.**  

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Name**: Customer Purchase Data  
- **Duration**: 1 Year  
- **Size**: XX MB  
- **Columns**:  
  - `Date`: Transaction date  
  - `Customer_ID`: Unique customer identifier  
  - `Product_Category`: Type of product purchased  
  - `Purchase_Amount`: Amount spent per transaction  
  - `Payment_Method`: Mode of transaction  
  - `Region`: Customer’s location  
  - `Return_Status`: Whether the item was returned  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy  
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **IDE**: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

## 🛠 Steps Completed  
✅ **Step 1: Data Preprocessing & Cleaning**  
- Handled missing values & duplicates  
- Standardized date format (`YYYY-MM-DD`)  
- Cleaned categorical variables  

✅ **Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – In Progress**  
- Understanding sales trends across months  
- Analyzing return rates & payment methods  

## 📈 Next Steps  
🔹 Feature Engineering for ML models  
🔹 Predictive Analytics for Purchase Patterns
